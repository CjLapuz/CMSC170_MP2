## Machine Problem 2  <br /> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs;p&nbsp; Consists of Two Parts: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs;p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs;p&nbsp; 1. K MEANS ALGORITHM <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs;p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs;p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs;p&nbsp; - Simulates the K means algorithm for 10 iterations <br /> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs;p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs;p&nbsp; 2. IMAGE COMPRESSION <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs;p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs;p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs;p&nbsp; - Applies the K means algorithm to compress a given image <br />
